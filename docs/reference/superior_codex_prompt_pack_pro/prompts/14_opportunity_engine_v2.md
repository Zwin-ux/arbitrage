# Prompt 14: Improve OpportunityEngine explanations, scoring coherence, and future extensibility

Paste this entire prompt into Codex.

You are working in the Superior repository from `arbitrage-main.zip`.

Ground truth from the repo:
- Public product name: Superior. Current Python package and entrypoints still use `market-data-recorder`.
- Stack: Python 3.11, PySide6 desktop app, DuckDB recorder core, Astro public site, PyInstaller + Inno Setup Windows packaging.
- Core packages:
  - `src/market_data_recorder/`: recorder core, CLI, storage, replay, verify, websocket/gamma/clob clients.
  - `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/`: onboarding wizard, profile store, keychain-backed credentials, scanner, paper bots, score attack, unlock flow, coach, diagnostics, Qt UI.
  - `site/`: Astro landing/docs/download surface with variant lab.
  - `packaging/windows/`: EXE + installer lane.
- Important desktop files and classes:
  - `window.py`: `DesktopMainWindow`, `ArcadeScannerWidget`, tab classes.
  - `ui/hangar.py`: newer Hangar-specific UI components.
  - `ui/shell.py`: shell, header, nav, state overlays.
  - `ui/theme.py`: `ThemeTokens`, stylesheet generation.
  - `wizard.py`: guided onboarding flow.
  - `bot_services.py`: `VenueAdapter`, `ContractMatcher`, `OpportunityEngine`, `PaperExecutionEngine`, `LiveExecutionEngine`, `UnlockService`, `ExperimentalLiveService`, `AssistantService`, `ArbitrageService`.
  - `score_attack.py`: bot blueprints/configs, unlock tracks, paper simulation, progression.
  - `qa_client.py`: product-level deterministic QA scenarios and headless report export.
- Existing product posture is intentionally trustworthy:
  - paper-first
  - live locked by default
  - local-first
  - keychain-only secrets
  - no profit guarantees
  - experimental live is staged and tiny
- Existing design docs matter:
  - `docs/superior-graphics-system.md`
  - `docs/risk-model.md`
  - `docs/architecture.md`
  - `docs/testing.md`
- Existing visual direction is already close to the target:
  - dark graphite/navy
  - thin vector geometry
  - radial scanner focal point
  - cyan / green / magenta / yellow accents
  - “focused 16-bit market machine”, not a finance dashboard
  - Polybius / arcade cabinet energy, but restrained and trustworthy

Global rules for every change:
1. Do not turn the product into a hypey “money printer”, casino skin, or fake AI trading app.
2. Keep the paper-first, live-gated, local-first trust posture intact unless the prompt explicitly asks for a carefully staged expansion.
3. Preserve current entrypoints and packaging compatibility unless the prompt explicitly includes a migration plan.
4. Respect the repo’s release lane: tests, mypy, QA client, Windows packaging, Astro site.
5. Prefer small, composable, well-named changes over giant rewrites.
6. If you consolidate duplicates, preserve behavior and add tests.
7. Every major feature must ship with:
   - code
   - tests
   - docs or inline product copy updates
   - a short acceptance checklist
8. Design language:
   - one clear focal point per screen
   - Polybius / arcade cabinet influence
   - thin vectors, scanlines, control bars, crisp edges
   - no thick glassmorphism, no blob gradients, no SaaS card soup
   - no crypto-bro neon overload
9. UX language:
   - literal, machine-like, explainable
   - “Paper mode active”, “Live gate locked”, “Routes found”
   - no fake confidence scores or unrealistic return language
10. Treat the current repo as a real product with a real spine. Upgrade it, do not casually flatten it into a toy demo.

## Objective

Refine `OpportunityEngine` so candidate generation, explanation quality, and scoring feel more coherent, extensible, and premium without pretending to discover magical edge.

## Files to inspect first

- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/bot_services.py`
- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/app_types.py`
- `tests/test_bot_services.py`
- `tests/test_arbitrage.py`
- `docs/risk-model.md`
- `docs/strategy-contributor-guide.md`

## What to change

1. Audit the current internal-binary, cross-venue, and lab-monitor scans for naming, scoring, evidence, and explanation consistency.
2. Refine the candidate model and explanation text so every candidate reads like a tactical dossier.
3. Make cost deductions, assumptions, and quality scoring easier to reason about and test.
4. Preserve the current posture: if the scanner lacks enough evidence, it should reject or monitor, not bluff confidence.

## Constraints

- Do not overcomplicate with ML or vague AI heuristics.
- Stay deterministic and testable.
- Keep exact-match and risk posture explicit.

## Deliverables

- production-quality code changes
- updated tests
- updated docs or in-app copy where the behavior changed
- a short implementation summary
- a short “follow-up opportunities” list

## Done bar

- Candidate explanations are cleaner and more useful.
- Scoring feels less arbitrary.
- The engine is easier to extend safely.
