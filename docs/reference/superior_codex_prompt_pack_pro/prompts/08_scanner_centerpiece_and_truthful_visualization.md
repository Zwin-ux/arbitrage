# Prompt 08: Turn Scanner into the truthful radial centerpiece of the app

Paste this entire prompt into Codex.

You are working in the Superior repository from `arbitrage-main.zip`.

Ground truth from the repo:
- Public product name: Superior. Current Python package and entrypoints still use `market-data-recorder`.
- Stack: Python 3.11, PySide6 desktop app, DuckDB recorder core, Astro public site, PyInstaller + Inno Setup Windows packaging.
- Core packages:
  - `src/market_data_recorder/`: recorder core, CLI, storage, replay, verify, websocket/gamma/clob clients.
  - `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/`: onboarding wizard, profile store, keychain-backed credentials, scanner, paper bots, score attack, unlock flow, coach, diagnostics, Qt UI.
  - `site/`: Astro landing/docs/download surface with variant lab.
  - `packaging/windows/`: EXE + installer lane.
- Important desktop files and classes:
  - `window.py`: `DesktopMainWindow`, `ArcadeScannerWidget`, tab classes.
  - `ui/hangar.py`: newer Hangar-specific UI components.
  - `ui/shell.py`: shell, header, nav, state overlays.
  - `ui/theme.py`: `ThemeTokens`, stylesheet generation.
  - `wizard.py`: guided onboarding flow.
  - `bot_services.py`: `VenueAdapter`, `ContractMatcher`, `OpportunityEngine`, `PaperExecutionEngine`, `LiveExecutionEngine`, `UnlockService`, `ExperimentalLiveService`, `AssistantService`, `ArbitrageService`.
  - `score_attack.py`: bot blueprints/configs, unlock tracks, paper simulation, progression.
  - `qa_client.py`: product-level deterministic QA scenarios and headless report export.
- Existing product posture is intentionally trustworthy:
  - paper-first
  - live locked by default
  - local-first
  - keychain-only secrets
  - no profit guarantees
  - experimental live is staged and tiny
- Existing design docs matter:
  - `docs/superior-graphics-system.md`
  - `docs/risk-model.md`
  - `docs/architecture.md`
  - `docs/testing.md`
- Existing visual direction is already close to the target:
  - dark graphite/navy
  - thin vector geometry
  - radial scanner focal point
  - cyan / green / magenta / yellow accents
  - “focused 16-bit market machine”, not a finance dashboard
  - Polybius / arcade cabinet energy, but restrained and trustworthy

Global rules for every change:
1. Do not turn the product into a hypey “money printer”, casino skin, or fake AI trading app.
2. Keep the paper-first, live-gated, local-first trust posture intact unless the prompt explicitly asks for a carefully staged expansion.
3. Preserve current entrypoints and packaging compatibility unless the prompt explicitly includes a migration plan.
4. Respect the repo’s release lane: tests, mypy, QA client, Windows packaging, Astro site.
5. Prefer small, composable, well-named changes over giant rewrites.
6. If you consolidate duplicates, preserve behavior and add tests.
7. Every major feature must ship with:
   - code
   - tests
   - docs or inline product copy updates
   - a short acceptance checklist
8. Design language:
   - one clear focal point per screen
   - Polybius / arcade cabinet influence
   - thin vectors, scanlines, control bars, crisp edges
   - no thick glassmorphism, no blob gradients, no SaaS card soup
   - no crypto-bro neon overload
9. UX language:
   - literal, machine-like, explainable
   - “Paper mode active”, “Live gate locked”, “Routes found”
   - no fake confidence scores or unrealistic return language
10. Treat the current repo as a real product with a real spine. Upgrade it, do not casually flatten it into a toy demo.

## Objective

Upgrade the Scanner screen so it becomes the visual and tactical centerpiece of Superior while staying completely truthful to available data.

## Files to inspect first

- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/window.py`
- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/bot_services.py`
- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/ui/theme.py`
- `tests/test_desktop_ui.py`
- `docs/superior-graphics-system.md`
- `docs/risk-model.md`

## What to change

1. Refine `ArcadeScannerWidget` and the surrounding Scanner layout so the radial machine visual is the focal point.
2. Show route candidates, explanations, gross edge, net edge, quality score, and route status with cleaner hierarchy.
3. Make the scanner explanation panel feel like a tactical readout, not a blob of text.
4. Ensure the visual reacts only to real candidate data and truthful machine state.
5. Improve empty / no-route / stale-state messaging.

## Constraints

- Do not add decorative motion unrelated to real state.
- Avoid fake heatmaps or pseudo-market visuals that imply data you do not have.
- Scanner must stay explainable.

## Deliverables

- production-quality code changes
- updated tests
- updated docs or in-app copy where the behavior changed
- a short implementation summary
- a short “follow-up opportunities” list

## Done bar

- The scanner is the clearest visual center in the app.
- Routes are easier to compare and understand.
- The screen feels like Superior’s signature surface.
