# Prompt 09: Make Paper Runs and Score feel like honest score attack, not fake trading theater

Paste this entire prompt into Codex.

You are working in the Superior repository from `arbitrage-main.zip`.

Ground truth from the repo:
- Public product name: Superior. Current Python package and entrypoints still use `market-data-recorder`.
- Stack: Python 3.11, PySide6 desktop app, DuckDB recorder core, Astro public site, PyInstaller + Inno Setup Windows packaging.
- Core packages:
  - `src/market_data_recorder/`: recorder core, CLI, storage, replay, verify, websocket/gamma/clob clients.
  - `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/`: onboarding wizard, profile store, keychain-backed credentials, scanner, paper bots, score attack, unlock flow, coach, diagnostics, Qt UI.
  - `site/`: Astro landing/docs/download surface with variant lab.
  - `packaging/windows/`: EXE + installer lane.
- Important desktop files and classes:
  - `window.py`: `DesktopMainWindow`, `ArcadeScannerWidget`, tab classes.
  - `ui/hangar.py`: newer Hangar-specific UI components.
  - `ui/shell.py`: shell, header, nav, state overlays.
  - `ui/theme.py`: `ThemeTokens`, stylesheet generation.
  - `wizard.py`: guided onboarding flow.
  - `bot_services.py`: `VenueAdapter`, `ContractMatcher`, `OpportunityEngine`, `PaperExecutionEngine`, `LiveExecutionEngine`, `UnlockService`, `ExperimentalLiveService`, `AssistantService`, `ArbitrageService`.
  - `score_attack.py`: bot blueprints/configs, unlock tracks, paper simulation, progression.
  - `qa_client.py`: product-level deterministic QA scenarios and headless report export.
- Existing product posture is intentionally trustworthy:
  - paper-first
  - live locked by default
  - local-first
  - keychain-only secrets
  - no profit guarantees
  - experimental live is staged and tiny
- Existing design docs matter:
  - `docs/superior-graphics-system.md`
  - `docs/risk-model.md`
  - `docs/architecture.md`
  - `docs/testing.md`
- Existing visual direction is already close to the target:
  - dark graphite/navy
  - thin vector geometry
  - radial scanner focal point
  - cyan / green / magenta / yellow accents
  - “focused 16-bit market machine”, not a finance dashboard
  - Polybius / arcade cabinet energy, but restrained and trustworthy

Global rules for every change:
1. Do not turn the product into a hypey “money printer”, casino skin, or fake AI trading app.
2. Keep the paper-first, live-gated, local-first trust posture intact unless the prompt explicitly asks for a carefully staged expansion.
3. Preserve current entrypoints and packaging compatibility unless the prompt explicitly includes a migration plan.
4. Respect the repo’s release lane: tests, mypy, QA client, Windows packaging, Astro site.
5. Prefer small, composable, well-named changes over giant rewrites.
6. If you consolidate duplicates, preserve behavior and add tests.
7. Every major feature must ship with:
   - code
   - tests
   - docs or inline product copy updates
   - a short acceptance checklist
8. Design language:
   - one clear focal point per screen
   - Polybius / arcade cabinet influence
   - thin vectors, scanlines, control bars, crisp edges
   - no thick glassmorphism, no blob gradients, no SaaS card soup
   - no crypto-bro neon overload
9. UX language:
   - literal, machine-like, explainable
   - “Paper mode active”, “Live gate locked”, “Routes found”
   - no fake confidence scores or unrealistic return language
10. Treat the current repo as a real product with a real spine. Upgrade it, do not casually flatten it into a toy demo.

## Objective

Use the existing score-attack systems to make Paper Runs and Score feel motivating, readable, and deeply tied to paper evidence.

## Files to inspect first

- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/window.py`
- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/score_attack.py`
- `src/market_data_recorder_desktop/bot_services.py`
- `tests/test_desktop_ui.py`
- `tests/test_bot_services.py`
- `docs/first-paper-run.md`

## What to change

1. Audit the current Paper Runs and Score surfaces and reframe them around session quality, banked score, unlock progression, and honest paper ledger review.
2. Make the last session, recent events, portfolio summary, and unlock track read as one system.
3. Prefer route bars, ledger strips, unlock badges, and session grades over generic finance charts.
4. Expose the most meaningful score-attack concepts: hit rate, realized edge, score delta, unlocked slots, and next unlock requirements.
5. Improve the microcopy so it sounds literal and disciplined.

## Constraints

- Do not make it look like a brokerage dashboard.
- Do not gamify with fake coins, flashy rewards, or confetti.
- Keep the core loop grounded in actual paper data.

## Deliverables

- production-quality code changes
- updated tests
- updated docs or in-app copy where the behavior changed
- a short implementation summary
- a short “follow-up opportunities” list

## Done bar

- Paper progress feels satisfying and honest.
- Score clearly explains advancement.
- The paper loop feels like a real game layer without becoming silly.
